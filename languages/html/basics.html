    <h1>The basics of html</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        HTML is a simple web development languages. 
        The whole thing makes up the web. 
        The acronym for HTML is "HyperText Markup Language" 
        Let's start off by adding basic HTML tags: 
    </p>
    <p>
        To start off, let's make sure 
        the computer, phone or tablet knows what kind of 
        file we are handling. Let's add the <code>DOCTYPE</code> tag: 
    </p>
    <img src="code.png">
    <p>
        Now, I will paste the image again. 
        The tag you will look at is the HTML tag. 
        Which says that everything within those tags 
        is HTML: 
    </p>
    <img src="code.png">
    <p>TBC...</p>
</html>
